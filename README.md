A Deep Purple fan website made with Django framework hosted on PythonAnywhere

https://pavelcyargeenka.eu.pythonanywhere.com/

This is a Deep Purple fan website built using the Django web framework. 
The website consists of two applications: a contact form and a management 
application. The contact form allows customers to send messages and sends 
emails to both the customer (a confirmation) and the admin 
(a notification of the receiving). The management application handles 
the rest of the website's functionality.
