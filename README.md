PavelCyargeenka.eu.pythonanywhere.com is a website dedicated to Deep Purple fans, 
built using the Django web framework and hosted on PythonAnywhere. 
It consists of two applications: a contact form that allows customers to send messages 
and receive email confirmations, as well as notifying the admin of new messages; 
and a management application that handles the rest of the website's functionality. 
While the CSS styles are still being refined, the website provides an enjoyable 
user experience for fans of the band. Visit https://pavelcyargeenka.eu.pythonanywhere.com/
